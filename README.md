# Notes
These are my notes from building a sample toolbox; so that it can easily be installed with pip.

# Create package
- Fill out the `setup.cfg` and `setup.py` files
- Run `python setup.py sdist` to create the local files
- Alternatively simply push the project to Github and install it with `python -m pip install https://github.com/Antra/toolbox_project/tarball/master#egg=sample_toolbox`
